# Bloom

Bloom is a simple application that helps amateur gardeners plant and care for their gardens. Users are able to learn about different fruits/vegetables, sort them by level of planting difficulty, and add them to their garden. The main focus for this project was the front-end development using React.

## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
